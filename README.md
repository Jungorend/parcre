# PARCRE

An attempt at a city simulation. Attempting to create a small economic system in motion and go from there.
At present nothing is implemented, and no plans yet how to interact with the simulation. However, the goal is the following:

- Fully autonomous world. The world should develop on its own, and natural economic forces lead to technology development, resource extraction, etc.
- Nothing is intended to be provided for the world. Goods that people need will need to be gathered, refined, and distributed

## Current Status
Still developing the basic systems needed for everything to interact, and getting a decent system for initializing it all. There is nothing that can be run just yet. Notes on future plans are stored in the *Design Notes.md* file, but the parce.py is the entry to the program, and city.py is a global object to store the state of all elements within this city.
